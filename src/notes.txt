NMI is at rom bank 15, starts at 29C6 (or E9C6 how the CPU sees it)

C910 area seems to be free space

nvm this below, it's not in the right rom bank. I suspect gimmick uses 8KB rom banks.
some free space at rom bank 15 is at file offset 3DDB7 (probably preferable) or 3CAD9 (has a weird 01 byte close to it, might be related to some data).



Bank 03 is being used during the NMI loop. Looks like at FF00 (file offset) there's some free space.
I could use this free space to switch banks.

OK. There are about 20 bytes of free space at file offset eF14C. You might be able to use this space
to switch some rom banks around, then write your code there, and return to NMI.
nvm this space seems to be used by something else

let's use EA05 to switch banks, and we'll run whatever code I replace in the other rom bank.

Free RAM: Maybe use 770?
